TAXOWALK(1)
===========

NAME
    taxowalk - classify product descriptions into the Shopify taxonomy

SYNOPSIS
    taxowalk [options] [description ...]

DESCRIPTION
    taxowalk uses the OpenAI gpt-5-mini model to identify the most suitable
    Shopify taxonomy node for a product description. The tool walks the
    taxonomy tree by repeatedly offering the model a list of candidate
    categories until a terminal node is reached.

OPTIONS
    --stdin
        Read the product description from standard input. Input must be piped.

    --openai-key KEY
        Provide the OpenAI API key explicitly. If omitted, taxowalk uses the
        OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable or the file %USERPROFILE%\.openai.key.

    --openai-base-url URL
        Override the OpenAI API base URL. Helpful when routing requests through
        a proxy or gateway.

    --taxonomy-url URL
        Specify an alternate taxonomy JSON file or URL. Defaults to the
        official Shopify taxonomy feed.

EXAMPLES
    taxowalk "Handmade leather tote bag"
    type description.txt | taxowalk --stdin

FILES
    %USERPROFILE%\.openai.key
        Default location for the OpenAI API key when no flag or environment
        variable is provided.
